gat.py
------
Graph Attention Network (GAT) placeholder.

NOTE:
This file is reserved for the upcoming GAT implementation. The class and file structure
follow the same modular design as the GCN components, ensuring easy integration later.

The final implementation will include:
- Attention coefficients α_ij computed via learnable weight vectors.
- Softmax normalization over neighborhoods.
- Multi-head attention aggregation.

Stay tuned — this will extend the current GCN foundation into attention-based GNNs.
